README: How to run the code.

Backend; download the latest version of the uvicorn module using pip (the one used on my computer was 'uvicorn 0.11.3 with CPython 3.8.10 on Linux').
After uvicorn has been downloaded, run "uvicorn api:app --reload" in the terminal to start up the backend API server.

Frontend; download the latest versions of nodejs and npm and run 'npm run dev' in a terminal to start up a local version of the web application. There is also
a separate README file auto generated by 'React' in the 'Frontend' directory with more details and variations of running the application. 

The application is already running and available at: https://turing-machine-app.herokuapp.com
